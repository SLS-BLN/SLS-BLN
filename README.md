I'm currently rebuilding my GitHub profile to support my career path:
**IT Support → Microsoft 365 Administration → Azure Administration**, with a strong focus on automation.

Current focus:
- PowerShell labs for Microsoft 365, Entra ID, and reporting tasks
- Python scripting fundamentals for automation and API integration
- Microsoft certification path: MS-900 → AZ-900 → MS-102 → AZ-104

Public repositories will follow soon, aligned with real-world admin tasks and safe-by-default scripting.
