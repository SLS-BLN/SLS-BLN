I'm currently rebuilding my GitHub profile as I transition into  
**Microsoft 365, Azure, and automation with PowerShell and Python.**

Right now, I'm working on:
- PowerShell automation labs (M365, Entra ID, reporting)
- Python fundamentals for scripting and automation
- My Microsoft certification path (MS-900 → AZ-900 → MS-102 → AZ-104)

Public repositories will follow soon as I structure my new learning projects.
